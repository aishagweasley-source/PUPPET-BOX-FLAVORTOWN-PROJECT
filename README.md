# PUPPET-BOX-FLAVORTOWN-PROJECT
This is a my first flavortown project. this project is inspired by a game from fnaf. its a simple project where im going to make a mini robot of the marrionnete puppet(charlie) from fnaf. how it works is that i will be using an ultrasonic sensor to measure the distance, and servos as arms to do a scare reaction for the puppt.
